Task1.   Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn
In this section we will see how the Python Scikit-Learn library for machine learning can be used to implement regression functions. We will start with simple linear regression involving two variables.
     Simple Linear Regression
In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves two variables.

Task2.    Unsupervised Machine Learning problem
K- Means Clustering: I have used KMeans algorithm to segrigate the iris dataset.
This algorithm is used to find the groups which have bot been explicitely labelled in data. It does the following steps,
   > Determine the centroid
   > Determine the distance od each object to the centroid
   > Group the object based on the minimum distance basis
kmeans.transform(dataset) method measurees each instances in dataset to every centroid and returns n,k dimensioned array, where k is #of clusters and n is the #of instances in dataset.

Task3.    Decision Tree Algorithm
For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. This classifies the dataset according to its target variable as per the users' favour.
